Flight Ticket Price Prediction
## Introduction
Accurate pricing techniques are essential for airlines to sustain profit and satisfy customer needs in the highly competitive and dynamic aviation business. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have transformed the way organizations analyze vast amounts of data to extract insights and make informed decisions. One such application is predicting flight ticket prices, a complex task influenced by numerous factors such as demand fluctuations, seasonal trends, fuel prices, and route popularity.

This project aims to leverage AI and ML to develop predictive models capable of accurately forecasting flight ticket prices. By utilizing historical flight data encompassing various attributes—such as airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, departure and arrival times, duration, and total stops—along with corresponding ticket prices, we strive to create robust algorithms that provide valuable insights for airlines and travelers. Our goal is to address the challenges of price uncertainty in the aviation sector and equip stakeholders with the knowledge needed to make better decisions regarding revenue management and ticket sales.

## Objectives
Develop Predictive Models: Create machine learning models that can accurately forecast flight ticket prices using historical data.
Assist Decision Making: Provide insights that help airlines optimize pricing strategies and travelers make informed ticket purchase decisions.
Analyze Influencing Factors: Understand the impact of various attributes on flight prices, such as demand variations, seasonal patterns, fuel costs, and route attractiveness.
## Methodology
Data Collection: Gather historical flight data, including attributes such as airline, date of journey, source, destination, route, departure and arrival times, duration, total stops, and ticket prices.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand data distributions, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between different attributes and ticket prices.
Feature Engineering: Create new features and select the most relevant ones to enhance model performance.
Model Development: Apply various machine learning algorithms, including regression techniques, to build models that predict flight ticket prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²) to assess their accuracy and robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve performance.
Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model for practical use, providing a user-friendly interface for airlines and travelers.
Results
The developed models demonstrated the capability to accurately predict flight ticket prices based on the provided historical data and contextual information. The insights obtained can help airlines refine their revenue management strategies and assist travelers in making cost-effective ticket purchasing decisions.

## Future Work
Future research could explore:

Real-Time Price Prediction: Integrating real-time data for dynamic price forecasting.
Additional Features: Incorporating more features such as weather conditions, economic indicators, and competitor pricing.
Advanced Models: Experimenting with advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
Broader Dataset: Expanding the dataset to include more airlines and routes for a more comprehensive analysis.
##Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the application of AI and ML in predicting flight ticket prices, offering valuable insights for the aviation industry. By leveraging historical data and contextual information, we developed predictive models that can help stakeholders navigate the complexities of ticket pricing, ultimately contributing to more informed decision-making and enhanced revenue management.
